# Fourier_Based_QML
This work aims to confirm the impact of the Fourier series on the quantum machine learning
model. We will propose models, tests, and demonstrations to achieve this objective. We designed
a quantum machine learning leveraged on the Hamiltonian encoding. With a subtle change, we
performed the trigonometric interpolation, binary and multiclass classifier, and a quantum signal
processing application. We also proposed a block diagram of determining approximately the Fourier
coefficient based on quantum machine learning. We performed and tested all the proposed models
using the Pennylane framework
